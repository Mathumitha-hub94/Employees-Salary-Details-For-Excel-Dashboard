# 👥Employees-Salary-Details-For-Excel-Dashboard

## 🎯Objective ##
*The objective of this project is to analyze employee salary data to gain meaningful insights into the organization’s compensation structure. The analysis aims to identify salary trends across departments, job roles, experience levels, and performance ratings while ensuring data accuracy through preprocessing and cleaning.*

### 📊Dataset Description: ###
*This dataset contains detailed information about employees joining an organization.
It consists of 151 records and 9 columns.*

 **🔑Key features**
  1. Identifies how salaries are spread across the organization (e.g., minimum, maximum, average, and median salary).
  2. Compares salary trends across different departments to understand budget allocation and compensation structure.
  3. Highlights salary differences based on job roles such as junior, mid-level, senior, and managerial positions.
  4. Examines the relationship between performance ratings and salary increments or bonuses.
  5. Supports policy improvements related to employee retention, salary standardization, and performance-based rewards.

 **🏁conclution**
 
*The study revealed that most salaries fall within the mid-range, while senior roles and high-performance employees receive significantly higher compensation. A few     inconsistencies such as missing values and outliers were detected and handled during preprocessing to ensure data reliability. The analysis also highlighted areas where salary standardization could improve, especially in roles with high variance or overlapping pay scales.*
